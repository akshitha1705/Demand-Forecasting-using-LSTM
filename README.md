# Demand-Forecasting-using-LSTM
The fashion industry is highly dynamic, with trends changing rapidly. Retailers face significant challenges in predicting demand for fashion items, often leading to overstocking or stockouts, which is both costly and inefficient.There is a need for a solution that can predict demand accurately in real-time to optimize inventory management and meet customer expectations.


 The objective of the project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts fashion item demand based on historical sales data, social media trends, and seasonal factors.
 
 The Solution utilizes LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Neural Networks for Time-Series forecasting, integrates seasonal patterns to improve accuracy.
 # Dataset
 To download dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fashionworldda/fashion-trend-dataset
 This dataset  includes sales data from 2018 to 2022, detailing various aspects of fashion products such as gender preference, category, pattern, color, age group target, seasonal preference, material, price, sales 
 count, reviews, ratings, and more.
# Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing techniques used in the project include Label Encoding to convert categorical data into numerical form, aggregating sales data by product, year, and month, and Scaling numerical features using MinMaxScaler to ensure consistent data ranges for effective model training.
